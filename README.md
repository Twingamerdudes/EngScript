# EngScript
It's a programming language, but there's a twist, you program with english.

Yes, **no more dumb programmer errors** (most of the time) and a **easy to read syntax**

# Setting up
Go into src/.env and add you're OPENAI Key. Then drag all files in the folder into the directory of you're project.

Then run setup.py and follow it's instructions. Tip: it's based to leave Project Path blank unless you need a more specified path then you're root folder.

That's it!

# Using
Go into main.en and start typing away. Everything is in english (no weird programming syntax here), look at the example programs if you're still confused on how to write programs.
